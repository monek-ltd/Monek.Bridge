System.Net.Http is required by Monek.Pos.Bridge.dll for .NET Framework 4.0. 

- It can be referenced through NuGet or manually included from the "Required" folder.
- System.Net.Http has it's own dependencies which are all in the "Optional" folder.


Or, it can be utilised directly from a suitable default installation in the GAC.

Testing has shown that these dependency libraries are not strictly required as .NET will be a little bit clever and pull in the suitable library references from other installed .NET 4.x flavours.

Specifically, on any modern Windows version System.Net.Http is installed in the GAC (Global Assembly Cache) along with .NET Framework 4.8 and this can be consumed by the Bridge library.
